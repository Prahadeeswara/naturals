# Merged Naturals Project

This unified React + TypeScript + Vite app merges two existing sites:

- **Home Page** → from `src.zip`
- **Payment Page** → from `index.zip`

### Routes
- `/` → Home page
- `/payment` → Payment page

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes
- Both UIs are preserved as they are.
- "Pay Now" button should navigate using React Router: `navigate('/payment')`
